# Advent Of Code

Advent of Code is a yearly advent competition following the Advent calendar. This is a repository of my attempts for 2023

Note, no inputs, are stored within this project. Inputs are read from the `year-<year>/day-<day>/` directory. 
Examples are included within to ensure tests will pass

All rust tests can be run by:
```shell
$ cargo test
```

Individual days may be run with `-p rs-<day>`, and individual parts with `--bin rs-<day>-pt<n>`
